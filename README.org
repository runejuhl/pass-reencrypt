* pass-reencrypt

Extension to pass to allow reencrypting a single password to the identities in
the nearest =.gpg-id= file.

Handy when you use a Yubikey with touch forced, and you don't really want to
hit the button 300 times right now...

Note: the script is quite hacky (sourcing bash by grepping parts of it...), and
should probably be upstreamed at some point.

** Installation

Clone repo, symlink [[file:reencrypt.bash][reencrypt.bash]] into =~/.password-store/.extensions=.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass reencrypt some/password
#+END_SRC

*** Example

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
$ pass reencrypt www/github.com
